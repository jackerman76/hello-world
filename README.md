This is the README file for our lab project!

Our program takes in two user inputs and prints out the two things that they entered.

## USAGE: 
```Python 
something1 = input("Please enter something.")
something2 = input("Please enter another thing.")

print("These are the two things you entered: {} and {} ".format(something1, something2))
```
# Contribution
Pull requests are welcome from contributors, but please make a new issue to discuss intended changes before doing so.

# LICENSE.md reasoning
We decided to utilize the MIT licensen because it is very permissive and welcoming for developers looking to contribute to open-source projects as well as businesses looking to utilize our project.  We also chose this license because we are not concerned with profiting from our project. 

# CODE-OF-CONDUCT reasoning
We decided to utilize the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because it sets expectations for how participants will behave when using and contributing to our project.  The code of conduct also creates a positive environment for the community. Furthermore, this code of conduct sets enforcement guidelines for violations in the code of conduct and provides a way of contacting project leaders to report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior.
